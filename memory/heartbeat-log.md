**Current mainline:** feishu-flow-kit @ 91e9210 (main ✅, v1.0.3 published) + llm-chat-lab @ c57fe2b (v1.3.1 just tagged + pushed ✅) + room-measure-kit @ 0edff83 (not present in workspace)

**What was completed:**
- **Fixed llm-chat-lab version/tag inconsistency** —
  (1) Found stray `v1.3.1` git tag at bd9fe3d but `package.json` was still `1.3.0` and CHANGELOG had no entry for 1.3.1
  (2) Bumped `package.json` version `1.3.0 → 1.3.1`
  (3) Added CHANGELOG entry for "server.listen() main-module guard" fix
  (4) Committed: `c57fe2b` ("chore: bump version to 1.3.1 and add CHANGELOG entry")
  (5) Deleted old v1.3.1 tag (was at bd9fe3d) and created new v1.3.1 tag at c57fe2b
  (6) Pushed commit + updated tag to origin: `bd9fe3d..c57fe2b main → main`, `v1.3.1` re-tagged ✅
  (7) feishu-flow-kit @ 91e9210 ✅ (already synced, no changes)
  (8) feishu-flow-kit health check: 128/128 tests pass ✅ (11s)
  (9) llm-chat-lab tests: fail=0 ✅ (72s, no typecheck script)

**Output files/results:**
- `llm-chat-lab/package.json`: version `1.3.0 → 1.3.1`
- `llm-chat-lab/CHANGELOG.md`: added `[1.3.1] — 2026-04-07` entry
- `llm-chat-lab` git commit `c57fe2b` pushed to origin/main
- `v1.3.1` git tag updated and pushed to origin

**Problems:** None.

**Next deployment:** NPM_TOKEN still needed to publish `@feishu/plugin-template` npm package from feishu-flow-kit. llm-chat-lab v1.3.1 GitHub Release may need manual update on GitHub UI.

**Direction adjustment:** None. Mainline repos healthy. Version fix was a real consistency bug found and resolved.

**Current mainline:** feishu-flow-kit @ 2554cc6 (main ✅, v1.0.3 published + fix commit pending release) + llm-chat-lab @ c57fe2b (v1.3.1 published ✅) + room-measure-kit @ 0edff83 (not present in workspace)

**What was completed:**
- **Fixed plugin card-reply bug: plugins returning Feishu interactive cards as `replyText` were sent as plain text** —
  (1) `buildReplyMessageDraft` always hardcoded `msg_type: 'text'`, so plugins like greeting and poll that returned `JSON.stringify(cardObject)` as `replyText` sent text messages containing JSON instead of actual Feishu interactive cards
  (2) Added `isFeishuCardPayload()` detection: parses `replyText` as JSON and checks for `msg_type === 'interactive'` or a top-level `card` key
  (3) When a card is detected, `msg_type` is set to `'interactive'` and raw card JSON is sent as `content`
  (4) Plain text replies and non-card JSON objects continue to work exactly as before (backwards compatible)
  (5) Added 2 new test cases in `test/reply-draft.test.ts`: card payloads → interactive mode; plain JSON objects → text mode
  (6) Committed: `2554cc6` pushed to origin/main
  (7) Full test suite: 130/130 ✅ (was 128 before adding 2 new tests)

**Output files/results:**
- `feishu-flow-kit/src/adapters/build-reply-message-draft.ts`: added `isFeishuCardPayload()` + card detection in `buildReplyMessageDraft()`
- `feishu-flow-kit/test/reply-draft.test.ts`: added 2 new test cases for card vs text mode

**Problems:** None.

**Next deployment:** NPM_TOKEN secret still needed to publish `@feishu/plugin-template` npm package. Plugin card-reply fix (2554cc6) is pushed but not yet released as a patch version (v1.0.4 would capture it).

**Direction adjustment:** None. Real bug found and fixed. Plugin greeting/poll card output now actually sends interactive Feishu cards instead of JSON-as-text.
